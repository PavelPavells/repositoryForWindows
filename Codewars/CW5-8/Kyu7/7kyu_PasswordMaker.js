// 7kyu - Password Maker

// One suggestion to build a satisfactory password is to start with a memorable phrase or sentence and make a password by extracting the first letter of each word.

// Even better is to replace some of those letters with numbers (e.g., the letter O can be replaced with the number 0):

// instead of including i or I put the number 1 in the password;
// instead of including o or O put the number 0 in the password;
// instead of including s or S put the number 5 in the password.
// Examples:
// "Give me liberty or give me death"  --> "Gml0gmd"
// "Keep Calm and Carry On"            --> "KCaC0"

let makePassword = p => p.replace(/i/ig,'1').replace(/o/ig,'0').replace(/s/ig,'5').split(' ').map(x=>x[0]).join('');
