// 7kyu - Palindromic Expression

// Welcome to yet another kata on palindromes!

// Your job is to return a string.

// The first half of the string should contain valid code in your language.

// When we receive your string, we will sum up the char codes of each character.

// The first half of your string will hopefully represent a function expression, because we

// will attempt to call it, passing in the sum as the input.

// If the output of the function is the same as the sum, then you pass the kata.

// The string must also be a palindrome in order for you to pass.
