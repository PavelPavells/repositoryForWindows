// 7kyu - Fix My Code

// Consider the string "adfa" and the following rules:

// a) each character MUST be changed either to the one before or the one after in alphabet. 
// b) "a" can only be changed to "b" and "z" to "y".
// From our string, we get:

// "adfa" -> ["begb","beeb","bcgb","bceb"]
// Another example: "bd" -> ["ae","ac","ce","cc"]
// --We see that in each example, one of the possibilities is a palindrome.
// I was working on the code for this but I couldn't quite figure it out. So far I have:

// const _ = require('lodash');
// function solve(s){
//     return (_.zip(s.split(""), s.split("").reverse()).map(e=>(e[0].charCodeAt(0)) - (e[1].charCodeAt(0)))).every(e=>["FIX"].includes(e));
// }
// I'm not sure what three numbers go into the array labelled ["FIX"]. This is the only thing missing.

// You will be given a lowercase string and your task is to return True if at least one of the possiblities is a palindrome or False otherwise. You can use your own code or fix mine.

// More examples in test cases. Good luck!

const _ = require('lodash');
let solve = s => (_.zip(s.split(""), s.split("").reverse()).map(a=>(a[0].charCodeAt(0)) - (a[1].charCodeAt(0)))).every(b=>"-2-0".includes(b));
