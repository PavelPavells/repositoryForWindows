// 7kyu  - Tab to Spaces

// ##Tabs to spaces!

// Suppose that in a developer team the agreed standard is to 
// always use spaces for alignment. Somebody from another team 
// with whom they cooperate uses another convention and regularly 
// checks in code containing tabs. Now all the times he changes 
// spaces to tabs or others change his tabs to spaces that will 
// appear as a diff in the version control system. Although most 
// diff tools can be configured to ignore whitespace diffs, this 
// still can be very annoying as it can add unnecessary difficulty 
// for the comparison of different versions. So it might be 
// 	worthwhile to write a script which periodically searches 
// the codebase to convert tabs to spaces, without changing the 
// visible code layout.
// This is the goal of the kata.

// In some editors, one can align words under each other with 
// tabs in the following manner: in a common convention a tab 
// can mean up to 4 spaces.
// It can mean any number of spaces between 1 and 4.

// When a tab is the 1st character in a row it means 4 spaces.
// When a tab is the 2nd character in a row it means just 3 spaces.
// When a tab is the 3rd character in a row it means just 2 spaces.
// When a tab is the 4th character in a row it means just 1 space.
// When a tab is the 5th character in a row it again means 4 spaces.
// And so on...

// The amount of spaces should calculated sequentially, from the 
// leftmost tab in every line.

// Write a function tabToSpaces that takes one argument, the text, 
// and replaces every tab with spaces.
// In the test cases tabs are represented by '\t' and newlines are 
// represented by '\n'.

// Example:

// a   bbb (a tab equals 3 spaces)
// aa  bb  (a tab equals 2 spaces)
// aaa b   (a tab equals 1 space)
//     b   (a tab equals 4 spaces)

let tabToSpaces = text => 
  text.replace(/.*/mg, str => {
  let ans = "";
  for (let s of str) 
    ans += s === '\t' ? Array(5 - ans.length % 4).join(" ") : s;
  return ans;
});
