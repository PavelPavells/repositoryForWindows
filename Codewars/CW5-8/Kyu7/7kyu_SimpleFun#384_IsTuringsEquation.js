// 7kyu - Simple Fun #384: Is Turing's Equation?

// Story
// Joe Stoy, in his book "Denotational Semantics", tells following story:

// The decision which way round the digits run is, of course, mathematically trivial.
// Indeed, one early British computer had numbers running from right to left (because
// the spot on an oscilloscope tube runs from left to right, but in serial logic the
// least significant digits are dealt with first). 

// Turing used to mystify audiences at public lectures when, quite by accident, 
// he would 
// slip into this mode even for decimal arithmetic, and write things like 73+42=16.

// The next version of the machine was made more conventional simply by crossing the
// x-deflection wires: this, however, worried the engineers, whose waveforms were all
// backwards. That problem was in turn solved by providing a little window so that the 
// engineers(who tended to be behind the computer anyway) could view the oscilloscope
// screen from the back. 

// [C. Strachey - private communication.]
// You will play the role of the audience and judge on the truth value of Turing's 
// equations.

// Task
// You are given a string s. It's an equation such as "a+b=c", where a, b, c are 
// numbers made up of the digits 0 to 9. This includes possible leading or 
// trailing zeros. The equations will not contain any spaces.

// Your task is to judge whether s is an valid Turing equation. Return true or 
// false, respectively, in Turing's interpretation, i.e. the numbers being read 
// backwards.

// Still not understand the task? Look at the following example ;-)

// Example
// For s = "73+42=16", the output should be true.

// 73 -> 37
// 42 -> 24
// 61 -> 61
// 37+24==61
// For s = "5+8=13", the output should be false.

// 5 -> 5
// 8 -> 8
// 13 -> 31
// 5+8!=31
// For s = "10+20=30", the output should be true.

// 10 -> 01 -> 1
// 20 -> 02 -> 2
// 30 -> 03 -> 3
// 1+2==3
// Note
// All the numbers a,b,c no more than 10 digits, excluding leading zeros(read 
// 	backwards)

// s contains only digits, "+" and "=", "-","*" or "/" will not appear in the 
// string.

// Happy Coding ^_^
